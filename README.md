# Hangman-Game
Zachary Venutos hangman game final project for CSI2300

In this application, a player can play a typical game of hangman. Players will select a difficulty level before attempting to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters, one at a time. Players will only have a certain number of guesses to get the word correct, so they must use their knowledge and skill to figure out the correct word before running out of attempts. 

To run this application, players must download all files from the source code and input them in Visual Studio Code. From there, they can run the code to open the GUI. Select a difficulty level, and start guessing letters in the text box!
